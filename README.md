# SERS-and-proteinuria


The goal of this project is to classify patients with high protein concentration in urine and the healthy group based on SERS (Surface Enchanced Raman Spectroscopy) spectral data and biomedical data.

Abstract of paper [2]:
Excessive protein excretion in human urine is an early and sensitive marker of diabetic nephropathy, primary and secondary renal disease. Kidney problems, particularly chronic kidney disease, remain among the few growing causes of mortality in the world. Therefore, it is important to develop efficient, expressive, and low-cost method for protein determination. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) methods are potential candidates to achieve those criteria. In this paper, the SERS method was developed to distinguish patients with proteinuria and the healthy group. Two types of commercial gold nanoparticles with a diameter of 60 nm and 100 nm were employed to prepare substrates for the analysis of 78 samples of unique patients. Data analysis by the PCA-LDA algorithm, and the ROC curves, gave results for diagnostic figures of merits. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 0.79, 0.89, 0.85, and 0.90 for the set with 60 nm Au NPs, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 0.79, 0.98, 0.90, and 0.91 for the set with 100 nm Au NPs, respectively. The results show the potential of SERS spectroscopy in differentiating between patients with proteinuria and healthy individuals for clinical diagnostics.
