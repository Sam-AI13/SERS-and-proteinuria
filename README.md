# SERS-and-proteinuria
IMPORTANT: This project will be published in a scientific journal. Some information might not be fully shown here as a result.

The end goal of this project is to classify patients with high protein concentration in urine and the healthy group based on SERS (Surface Enchanced Raman Spectroscopy) spectral data and biomedical data.
This project is to be released as a research paper later in 2022 or 2023. Some information might not be fully shown here as a result.

The project is divided into several Jupyter notebooks with the following names:

Import raw urine spectra (part 1)
Spectra processing (part 2)
Classification of patients (part 3)
Biomedical data (part 4)
Comparison of nanoparticles (part 5)

Part of the upcoming abstract: Excessive protein excretion in human urine is an early and sensitive marker of diabetic nephropathy, 
primary and secondary renal disease. Kidney problems, particularly chronic kidney disease, remain among the few growing causes of mortality in the world. 
Therefore, it is important to develop efficient, expressive, and low-cost method for protein determination. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) 
methods are potential candidates to achieve those criteria. In this paper, the SERS methods was developed to distinguish patients with proteinuria and the 
healthy group. Commercial gold nanoparticles with the diameter of 60 nm and 100 nm, and silver nanoparticles with the diameter of 100 nm were employed. 
Silver, gold, silicon and test slides covered with aluminium tape were utilized as substrates. Obtained spectra were analysed with several 
machine learning algorithms coupled with the PCA, ROC curve, and cross-validation methods.
